Residents were going about their morning routines, getting ready for work and school, when something strange happened. As they made their way down the hallways, they noticed that something was off with the cats that lived in the building. They seemed to be moving a bit faster than usual, and there was an air of mystery about them. As it turns out, these cats were immortal. No one knew how or why this was the case, but the cats seemed to have found a way to live forever.\n\nThe residents quickly realized that these cats were different than any they had ever encountered before. They were more independent, more mysterious, and more wise. They seemed to be able to sense things that were going to happen before they happened, and often gave advice to the other cats and the humans living in the building.\n\nThe immortal cats quickly became beloved by the residents, and the building quickly became a haven for any cat looking for refuge. The cats were always around to offer comfort, advice, and comfort. They would sit on the windowsills, looking out onto the streets of New York, and they seemed to be watching over the people in the building.\n\nThough the cats were immortal, they still needed to eat, drink, and take care of their other needs. This was no problem for the residents, who were more than happy to help out the cats in any way they could. The building soon became a home for the cats, a place where they could live, explore, and grow old together. \n\nThe immortal cats of the Upper West Side high-rise have become a source of comfort, companionship, and joy for the people living in the building. Whether it's a morning stroll in the park or an evening chat on the roof, the cats are always there, just as they have been for centuries. It's a beautiful thing, this unbreakable bond between the cats and the humans of the building. It's a bond that will never, ever die.",

As he journeyed deep into the darkest corners of the realm, he was suddenly confronted by a powerful and mysterious force. He was told that in order to stop the dark force, he must accept a new form, one that granted him great power, but also great danger. \n\nAlthough hesitant at first, Hildibrand soon embraced his new form, and with it, a newfound power. As Gandalf the Grey, he was able to command the elements, weave powerful enchantments, and command the forces of nature. However, with this new power came a great responsibility, and with it, a heavy burden. Gandalf the Grey was not only a powerful force of nature, but also a figure of great wisdom and knowledge. \n\nWith the help of the Warrior of Light and Nashu, Gandalf the Grey was able to locate a powerful artifact which, when used in conjunction with a special ritual, could restore his regular, most gentlemanly form. After a long and difficult journey, the artifact was located and the ritual was performed. With the artifact in hand and the ritual completed, Gandalf the Grey was returned to his rightful form, and the realm was safely returned to balance.",

    "output":"Farming experience in Minecraft can be done in a variety of ways. One of the most effective ways is to use an experience farm, which is a structure that continuously spams experience to characters standing in it. This method is effective because it does not require the player to do anything other than build the experience farm, and experience will continuously be generated as long as the player has characters standing in it. However, this method is limited in that it can only generate experience for one specific character, so it is not suitable for farming experience for multiple characters.\n\nAnother way to farm experience in Minecraft is through grinding. This involves going to a place with lots of monsters, such as a cave or a dungeon, and fighting them to gain experience. This method is effective because it allows the player to gain experience quickly, but it has the downside of requiring the player to be present in the game to gain experience, meaning that it is not suitable for farming experience while away from the computer.",

He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?",
    "output":"Hey there,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that your trip isn't going as planned. I think it's understandable that you would want to get away from your friend if he is not enjoying the activities and is being so quiet. I think the best approach would be to talk to him in a calm and understanding way. You can tell him that you understand he doesn't want to chat but that you would still like to spend time together and enjoy the trips. You can also suggest activities that he might like and try to make him feel comfortable to open up. You can also ask him why he is so quiet and if there is anything he would like to do, or if he wants to do something else. Letting him know that you care about his opinion and that you want to make sure he is enjoying himself can go a long way.\n\nIf that doesn't work, then you can definitely go your separate ways and book your own car in Picton. It is understandable that you want to relax and enjoy your trip, and if your friend is not open to any of the suggestions mentioned above, then it might be best to go your separate ways.\n\nI hope this helps!

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

To compare strings, you should use the.equals() method, which will compare the actual content of the strings.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects.

Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
