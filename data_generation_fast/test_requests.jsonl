Output:\nSol: Let x = the number of \"5 hour\" days, y = the number of \"3 hour\" days.\nWe know there are seven days in the week, so: x + y = 7.\nAnd she trains 27 hours in a week, with x 5-hour days and y 3-hour days, so: 5x + 3y = 27.\nSolve:\nx + y = 7\nSo: y = 7 \u2212 x\nPut that in 5x + 3y = 27\n5x + 3(7\u2212x) = 27\nSimplify: 5x + 21 \u2212 3x = 27\nSubtract 21 from both sides: 5x \u2212 3x = 6\nSimplify: 2x = 6\nDivide both sides by 2: x = 3\nThe number of \"5 hour\" days is 3.\n###\n2.
